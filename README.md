# WOPS
Water Overflow Prevention System

This project is an Arduino-based water overflow prevention system.  
It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect the water level and prevents overflow.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `start.bat` to start the application.

That's it!  
Make sure your Arduino board is connected properly before starting.(My dumbass forgot to add the arduino circut and the code)
